# Image2Ascii
### Features
- Converts nearly any image into an ascii representation of itself.
- Supports BMP, JPEG, PNG, GIF (First Frame), and TIFF file types.
- Allows for a full, scaled, or set resolution output.

---

### Usage
-  Outputs a full 1:1 pixel to character Ascii-image.
`Image2Ascii image.png` 

- Outputs a scaled image. (Recommended)
 `Image2Ascii image.png 10`  *Ascii-image scaled to 10% of its original size.*
 `Image2Ascii image.png 50`  *Ascii-image scaled to 30% of its original size.*

- Outputs a set resolution character image.
`Image2Ascii image.png 300 300`  *Ascii-image will be 300 x 300 characters.*

**Ascii-image** refers to the image made up of characters produced by the program.

Output is given via the console window and written into a text file with the same name as the image file with an appended .txt extension.

I recommend the scaled image option (30% is a decent start) if you want to share the image or view it easily. The full scale version will require a lot of zooming in your text editor / browser and is generally overkill.
